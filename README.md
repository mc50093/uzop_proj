# Introduction to data science project. Goal: To verify results of 3W classification paper and improve performance if possible

To do:

1. refactor, refactor, refactor

2. "classification is performed during the transient phase of the event" - what does this mean. Does a part of the dataset need to be cut off?
   "The transient stage was labelled as beginning at..." - relation to previous statement?
  
3. impute data before downsampling  

4. understand role of splitting data 3 times, train, test, validation

5. make performance measurents other than f1 score. (eg. accuracy)

6. explain why some models are overperforming compared to paper results. Possible solution: see 2.
