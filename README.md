# Introduction to data science project. Verify results of 3W classification paper and improve performance if possible

To do:

1. refactor, refactor, refactor

2. "classification is performed during the transient phase of the event" - what does this mean. Does a part of the dataset need to be cut off?
   "The transient stage was labelled as beginning at..." - relation to previous statement?
  
3. impute data before downsampling  
  
4. perform classification with window size hyperparameter 600s and 900s

5. understand role of splitting data 3 times, train, test, validation

6. determine which kind of f1 score is used in the paper.

6. make performance measurents other than f1 score.

7. explain why the model is overperforming compared to paper results.
